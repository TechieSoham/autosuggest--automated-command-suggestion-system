# 🚀 Command Autocomplete using Trie (C++)

This project implements a simple **command autocomplete** system using the **Trie** data structure in C++.  
It reads a list of commands and their descriptions from a file (`commands.txt`) and provides intelligent suggestions based on user input.

---

## 📚 How It Works
- Commands and their descriptions are loaded from `commands.txt`.
- Commands are inserted into a Trie structure (in lowercase for case-insensitive matching).
- When the user types a prefix, the program suggests matching commands along with their descriptions.
